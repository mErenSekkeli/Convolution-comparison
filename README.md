# My Own Convolution algorithm,Ready Convolution and Correlation Comparison
in this project, I will implement my own convolution algorithm and compare it with the ready convolution algorithm in python and the correlation algorithm. What we are going to do is to sample an oil tank and then find other tanks in the different images.

We are going to use for sampling the following image: 

![Alt text](Data/temp_data_10.PNG?raw=true "Title")


## Data
The Data folder contains the sampling data and test images. Test images.

Test images:

![Alt text](Data/Resim2_3.jpg?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](Data/Resim3_2.jpg?raw=true "Title")

As you can see, in the test images there are different number of tanks and we want to find and mark using these 3 algorithms.
